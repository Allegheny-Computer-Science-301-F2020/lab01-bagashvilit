### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - "COVID-19 Tracking App Available To The Public"

-  Reference or article citation.
 - [link to the article](https://wbhm.org/2020/covid-19-tracking-app-available-to-the-public/)

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - This article basically is describing the "GuideSafeâ„¢ Exposure Notification App", how it works and why it can be useful for people. Users can identify if they have been in close contact with infected person, so that they can seek for medical help and isolate themselves.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - In my opinion collecting data about who the person has been in contact with and whether they tested positive for covid-19 may lead to some serious privacy issues.
 This data may be easily violated, if the identities of infected users is revealed, or other third parties get access to the data that has the list of people wich user has been in contact with, and the data is used, for example, for marketing purposes. 

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data used by this app consists of reports made by individuals whether they
 tested positive for covid-19, the app also uses the data that consists of list of people the user has been in contact with. 

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - This app just like other Covid-19 tracking apps uses Bluetooth, wich lets the app collect the data about the length and distance of the contact with other people. The length usually is 15 minutes and the distance between people is 6 feet. Its important that both people use the app, in order for it to work.
 Once the person finds out that they tested positive for Covid-19 they upload it to the app, so that if they get in close contact with other people, they get the notification about possible contact with infected person.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - I think that people may gain from this data analisis to track if they have been in contact with infected person and to seek for medical help early on, isolate themselves and protect others. But at the same time they may risk their privacy, because just like other users they will also be reporting if they tested positive for Covid-19.
