    "COVID-19 Tracking App Available To The Public"

-  Reference or article citation.

    [link to the article](https://wbhm.org/2020/covid-19-tracking-app-available-to-the-public/)

- Briefly describe the article's premise.

    This article basically is describing the "GuideSafeâ„¢ Exposure Notification App", how it works and why it can be useful for people. Users can identify if they have been in close contact with infected person, so that they can seek for medical help and isolate themselves.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?

    In my opinion collecting data about who the person has been in contact with and whether they tested positive for covid-19 may lead to some serious privacy issues.
    This data may be easily violated, if the identities of infected users is revealed, or other third parties get access to the data that has the list of people wich user has been in contact with, and the data is used, for example, for marketing purposes. 

- What data is being manipulated in the article?

    The data used by this app consists of reports made by individuals whether they
    tested positive for covid-19, the app also uses the data that consists of list of people the user has been in contact with. 

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.

    This app just like other Covid-19 tracking apps uses Bluetooth, wich lets the app collect the data about the length and distance of the contact with other people. The length usually is 15 minutes and the distance between people is 6 feet. Its important that both people use the app, in order for it to work.
    Once the person finds out that they tested positive for Covid-19 they upload it to the app, so that if they get in close contact with other people, they get the notification about possible contact with infected person.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?

    I think that people may gain from this data analisis to track if they have been in contact with infected person and to seek for medical help early on, isolate themselves and protect others. But at the same time they may risk their privacy, because just like other users they will also be reporting if they tested positive for Covid-19.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
    "Amazon Using AI, Big Data To Accelerate Profits"

-  Reference or article citation.
    [link to the article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmarkman/2017/06/05/amazon-using-ai-big-data-to-accelerate-profits/#361b67b86d55)

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
    The article introduces Amazon Echo look, technology that can evaluate the cloths you are wearing and make sugestions on how to improve your style. And also shows how the data gathered can be monetized.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
    Even though having a "Personal stylist" sounds like a great idea I agree with the author that it is more like Amazon dictating what is "cool", based on the data that it already gathered and manipulating with it. I think that this may even become a way to massively manipualate with the users, and their prefernces.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
    Data gathered about the user such as their prefernces, size of cloths, latest trends.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
    The Amazon Echo look takes photo of the person sends to the cloud. Also takes other data such as users prferences, sizes and in combination to the latest fashion trends, gives the user feedback/suggestions on how to improve using some algorithms.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
    I think that the company definitely monetizes this data, and gets profit from it. And I believe that while suggestions may be helpful the users may have privacy concers as well as concern that their style may be manipulated.
